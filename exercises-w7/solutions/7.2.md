```cpp
auto demo(void) -> void {
    // the data constructor calls make_unique which allocates heap memory for the number_ member
    auto territories = data(2);
    // this line doesn't do any heap memory management
    std::cout << "there are " << territories.number_.operator*() << " territories in the Commonwealth of Australia\n";
    /**
        * we have reached the end of the scope
        * in practical terms this is the line before the most-indented closing brace ('}')
        * the compiler will call the destructor for data on territories
        * the destructor for std::unique_ptr is called and now the number_ member is freed
    */
}
```

This question is meant to showcase how RAII and the STL simplify how we interact with heap resources in C++:

- we only have to construct an object;
- all heap resource management onward, was handled by that object \(i.e. we didn't have to free any heap resources\);
- the C++ compiler will automatically destruct the object at the end of its scope;
- this was the reference to a part of the code which wasn't a "C++ expression, but rather a syntax symbol" in the original spec.
